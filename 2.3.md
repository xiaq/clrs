Rewrite the \proc{Merge} procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array $L$ or $R$ has had all its elements copied back to $A$ and then copying the remainder of the other array back into $A$.

\Solution

\begin{codebox}
\Procname{$\proc{Merge}(A, p, q, r)$}
\li $n_1 \gets q - p + 1$
\li $n_2 \gets r - q$
\li \text{let $L[1 \twodots n_1]$ and $R[1 \twodots n_2]$ be new arrays}
\li \For $i \gets 1 \To n_1$
\li \Do
        $L[i] \gets A[p+i-1]$
    \End
\li \For $j \gets 1 \To n_2$
\li \Do
    $R[j] \gets A[q+j]$
    \End
\li $i \gets 1$
\li $j \gets 1$
\li \For $k \gets p \To r$
\li \Do
        \If $j > n_2$ \kw{or} ($i \le n_1$ \kw{and} $L[i] \le R[j]$)
\li     \Then
            $A[k] \gets L[i]$
\li         $i \gets i + 1$
\li     \Else
            $A[k] \gets R[j]$
\li         $j \gets j + 1$
        \End
    \End
\end{codebox}

Use mathematical induction to show that when $n$ is an exact power of 2, the solution of the recurrence

$$
T(n) = \begin{cases}
    2 & \text{if } n = 2 \text{,} \\
    2 T(n/2) + n & \text{if } n = 2^k \text{, for } k > 1
\end{cases}
$$

is $T(n) = n \lg n$.

\Solution

\noindent \textbf{Induction Basis}: When $n = 2$, $T(n) = n \lg n$ holds.

\noindent \textbf{Inductive Step}: Suppose that $T(n) = n \lg n$ holds for $n = 2^k$, i.e. $T(2^k) = 2^k \lg 2^k = k \cdot 2^k$. Then $T(2^{k+1}) = 2 T(2^k) + 2^{k+1} = k \cdot 2^{k+1} + 2^{k+1} = (k+1) \cdot 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+1} \lg 2^{k+1}$, i.e. $T(n) = n \lg n$ holds for $n = 2^{k+1}$.

We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort $A[1 \twodots n]$, we recursively sort $A[1 \twodots n-1]$ and then insert $A[n]$ into the sorted array $A[1 \twodots n-1]$. Write a recurrence for the running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.

\Solution

$$
T(n) = \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } n = 1 \\
    T(n-1) + c_1 n + c_2 & \text{if } n \ge 2
\end{cases}
$$

Referring back to the searching algorithm (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence $A$ is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against $v$ and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The \textit{\textbf{binary search}} algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is $\Theta(\lg n)$.

\Solution

The following procedure takes an array $A$, its size $n$ and the element to find $x$, and returns the index of $x$ within $A$. If $x$ is not found in $A$, a special value, \textsc{Not-Found}, is returned. The loop invariant is: If $x$ can be found in $A$, it is in the subarray $A[l \twodots h]$.

\begin{codebox}
\Procname{$\proc{Binary-Search}(A, n, x)$}
\li $l \gets 1$
\li $h \gets n$
\li \While $l \le h$ \label{lh-loop-begin}
\li \Do
        $m \gets \lfloor (l+h)/2 \rfloor$
\li     \If $A[m] \isequal x$
\li     \Then
            \Return m
\li     \ElseIf $A[m] < x$
\li     \Then
            $l \gets m+1$
\li     \Else
            $h \gets m-1$
        \End
    \End \label{lh-loop-end}
\li \Return \textsc{Not-Found}
\end{codebox}

The running time is linear to the number of iterations of the loop in lines \ref{lh-loop-begin}-\ref{lh-loop-end}. In the worst case, element $x$ is not found in $A$. Each iteration reduces the size of the subarray in half\footnote{We are being sloppy here. Actually, each iteration reduces a subarray of size $m$ to either $\lfloor (m-1)/2 \rfloor$ or $\lceil (m-1)/2 \rceil$, neither being exactly $m/2$. A rigorous argument will require more details.}, so the loop runs $\Theta(\lg n)$ iterations. Hence the worst-case running time is $\Theta(\lg n)$.

2.3-6

Observe that the \While loop of lines 5-7 of the \proc{Insertion-Sort} procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray $A[1 \twodots j-1]$. Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to $\Theta(n \lg n)$?

\Solution

No. Although we can now *find* the point to insert $A[j]$ into the sorted subarray $A[1 \twodots j-1]$ in at most $\Theta(\lg n)$ time, in the worst case it will still take $\Theta(n)$ time to actually *insert* the element.
